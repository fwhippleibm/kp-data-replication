# This file contains translations for the sample workload generator for the DEFAULT locale.

producer.summary = This tool can be used to produce load to your Event Streams instance. To run you will need to modify the 'producer.config' file to reference your Event Streams instance and provide the required security information. If you do not have a 'producer.config' file, one can be generated by running --gen-config command.
producer.configSection = Configuration commands
producer.requiredConfigSection = Required arguments
producer.generalConfigSection = Additional arguments
producer.payload.options = Finally, either --record-size or --payload-file must be specified, but not both.
producer.topic.help = the topic to produce messages to. This must already exist on your Event Streams instance.
producer.numrecords.help = the number of messages to produce.
producer.recordSize.help = the message size in bytes.
producer.payloadFile.help = a file to read the message payloads from. This works only for UTF-8 encoded text files. Payloads will be read from this file and a payload will be randomly selected when sending messages. 
producer.payloadDelimeter.help = provides delimiter to be used when --payload-file is provided. Defaults to new line ('\\n'). Note that this parameter will be ignored if --payload-file is not provided.
producer.throughput.help = throttle maximum message throughput to approximately THROUGHPUT messages a second. The default value will try to produce as many messages as possible a second.
producer.producerConfigFile.help = producer configuration properties file. This file defines where your Event Streams instance is, security credentials to connect to it, and other producer configuration options. This can be generated via the --gen-config command. If not specified, the tool will assume this configuration is in the current working directory.
producer.printMetrics.help = print out metrics at the end of the producer run.
producer.numThreads.help = the number of threads on which to run producers. Total load will be split between the threads.
producer.size.help = the size of load to send using the producer: small (numRecords = 60000, throughput = 1000), medium (numRecords = 600000, throughput = 10000) or large (numRecords = 6000000, throughput = 100000). This parameter overrides --num-records and --throughput if set
producer.genConfig.help = This command will generate a 'producer.config' file which will define the basic configuration required to produce messages to an Event Streams instance. You will need to modify this file. For guidance on the configuration options and how to change them, refer to the comments in the file.
producer.envar.warning = ES_THROUGHPUT and ES_NUM_RECORDS have not both been set, so size will not be overridden if it has been used as an argument.

producer.fileGenerated = A 'producer.config' file has been successfully generated in your current working directory. Modify this file as described and provide this file to future runs via the --producer.config argument.
producer.fileGenerationFail = An error occurred while generating the 'producer.config' file.
producer.argsMissing = 'Warning: One or more required arguments were not provided. Please review the expected arguments and your provided input.'
producer.invalidThreads = 'Error: You specified an invalid number of threads. Please specify a positive integer value.'
producer.invalidThroughput = 'Error: You specified an invalid number throughput value. Please specify either -1 for unlimited, or a positive integer value.'
