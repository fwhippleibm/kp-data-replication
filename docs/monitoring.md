# Monitoring Mirror Maker and kafka connect cluster

The goal of this note is to go over some of the details on how to monitor Mirror Maker 2.0 metrics using Prometheus and Grafana for the dashboard.

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) is an open source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit that, with Kubernetes, is part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It can monitor multiple workloads but is normally used with container workloads.

The following figure presents the prometheus generic architecture as described from the product main website. Basically the Prometheus server hosts job to poll HTTP end points to get metrics from the components to monitor. It supports queries in the format of `PromQL`, that product like Grafana can use to present nice dashboards, and it can push alerts to different channels when some metrics behave unexpectedly.

In the context of data replication between kafka clusters, we want to monitor the mirror maker 2.0 metrics like the worker task states, source task metrics, task errors,... The following figure illustrates the components involved: The source Kafka cluster, the Mirror Maker 2.0 cluster, which is based on Kafka Connect, the Prometheus server and the Grafana.

As all those components run on kubernetes, most of them could be deployed via Operators using Custom Resource Definitions.

To support this monitoring we need to do the following steps:

1. Add metrics configuration to your Mirror Maker 2.0 cluster
1. Package the mirror maker 2 to use [JMX Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter)as Java agent so it exposes JMX MBeans as metrics accessibles via HTTP.
1. Deploy Prometheus via Opertors
1. Optionally deploy Prometheus Alertmanager
1. Deploy Grafana

## Installation and configuration

Prometheus deployment inside Kubernetes uses operator as defined in [the coreos github](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator). The CRDs define a set of resources: the ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, and PrometheusRule.

Inside the [Strimzi github repository](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator), we can get a [prometheus.yml](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/blob/master/examples/metrics/prometheus-install/prometheus.yaml) file to deploy prometheus server using the [Prometheus operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator). This configuration defines, ClusterRole, ServiceAccount, ClusterRoleBinding, and the Prometheus resource instance. We have defined our own configuration in [this file](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/kp-data-replication/blob/master/monitoring/prometheus.yml).

*For your own deployment you have to change the target namespace, and the rules*

You need to deploy Prometheus and all the other elements inside the same namespace or OpenShift project as the Kafka Cluster or the Mirror Maker 2 Cluster.

To be able to monitor your own on-premise Kafka cluster, you need to enable Prometheus metrics. An example of Kafka cluster Strimzi based deployment with Prometheus setting can be found [in our kafka cluster definition](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/kp-data-replication/blob/master/openshift-strimzi/kafka-cluster.yaml). The declarations are under the `metrics` stanza and define the rules for exposing Kafka core features.

### Install Prometheus Operator

We recommend reading [Prometheus operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator) product documentation. 

At a glance the Prometheus operator deploy and manage a prometheus server and watches new pods to monitor when they are scheduled within k8s. 

![prometheus-operator architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/master/Documentation/user-guides/images/architecture.png)

##### Source: prometheus-operator architecture

After creating a namespace or reusing the Kafka cluster namespace, you need to deploy the Prometheus operator and related service account, cluster role, role binding... We have reuse the `monitoring/install/bundle.yaml` from Prometheus operator github, with a namespace sets for our project (e.g `jb-kafka-strimzi`):

```shell
oc apply -f bundle.yaml
# Authorise the prometheus-operator to do cluster work
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user prometheus-operator --serviceaccount prometheus-operator -n eda-strimzi-kafka24
```

When you apply those configurations, the following resources are visibles:

| Resource | Description |
| --- | --- |
|ClusterRole | To grant permissions to Prometheus to read the health endpoints exposed by the Kafka and ZooKeeper pods, cAdvisor and the kubelet for container metrics.|
| ServiceAccount | For the Prometheus pods to run under. |
| ClusterRoleBinding | To bind the ClusterRole to the ServiceAccount.|
| Deployment | To manage the Prometheus Operator pod. |
| ServiceMonitor | To manage the configuration of the Prometheus pod.|
| Prometheus | To manage the configuration of the Prometheus pod. |
| PrometheusRule | To manage alerting rules for the Prometheus pod. |
|  Secret | To manage additional Prometheus settings. |
| Service  | To allow applications running in the cluster to connect to Prometheus (for example, Grafana using Prometheus as datasource) |

* To delete the operator do: `oc delete -f bundle.yaml`

### Deploy prometheus

!!! Note
        The following section is including the configuration of a Prometheus server monitoring a full Kafka Cluster. For Mirror Maker 2 or Kafka Connect monitoring, the configuration will have less rules, and parameters. See [next section](#mirror-maker-monitoring).

Deploy the prometheus server by first changing the namespace and also by adapting [the original examples/metrics/prometheus-install/prometheus.yaml file](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/blob/master/examples/metrics/prometheus-install/prometheus.yaml).

```shell
curl -s  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/master/examples/metrics/prometheus-install/prometheus.yaml | sed -e "s/namespace: myproject/namespace: jb-kafka-strimzi/" > prometheus.yml
```

If you are using AlertManager (see [section below](#alert-manager)) Define the monitoring rules of the kafka run time: KafkaRunningOutOfSpace, UnderReplicatedPartitions, AbnormalControllerState, OfflinePartitions, UnderMinIsrPartitionCount, OfflineLogDirectoryCount, ScrapeProblem (Prometheus related alert), ClusterOperatorContainerDown, KafkaBrokerContainersDown, KafkaTlsSidecarContainersDown

```shell
curl -s
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/master/examples/metrics/prometheus-install/prometheus-rules.yaml sed -e "s/namespace: default/namespace: jb-kafka-strimzi/" > prometheus-rules.yaml
```

```shell
oc apply -f prometheus-rules.yaml
oc apply -f prometheus.yaml
# once deploye, get the state of the server with
oc get prometheus
NAME         VERSION   REPLICAS   AGE
prometheus             1          52s
```

The Prometheus server configuration uses service discovery to discover the pods (Mirror Maker 2.0 pod or kafka, zookeeper pods) in the cluster from which it gets metrics.

## Configure monitoring

To start monitoring our Kafka 2.4 cluster we need to add some monitoring prometheus scrapper definitions, named service monitoring.

```
oc apply -f strimzi-service-monitor.yaml
oc describe servicemonitor
```

## Mirror maker 2.0 monitoring

To monitor MM2 with Prometheus we need to add JMX Exporter and run it as Java agent.The jar file for JMX exporter agent can be [found here](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter). We copied a version in the folder `mirror-maker-2/libs`. We have adopted a custom mirror maker 2.0 docker imaged based on Kafka 2.4. We are detailing how to build this image using this [Dockerfile](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/kp-data-replication/blob/master/mirror-maker-2/Dockerfile) in this [separate note](mm2-provisioning.md). We have used this approach as we have found an issue with the Strimzi Mirror Maker operator, that blocks us to continue the monitoring. We expect that htis operator, when it sees metrics declaration in the Mirror Maker 2 configuration yaml file, with use the JMX exporter jar.

Once the Mirror Maker 2.0 is connected...

## Install Grafana

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) provides visualizations of Prometheus metrics. Again we will use the Strimzi dashboard definition as starting point to monitor Kafka cluster but also mirror maker.

* Deploy Grafan to OpenShift and expose it via a service:

```shell
oc apply -f grafana.yaml
```

In case you want to test grafana locally run: `docker run -d -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana`

## Kafka Explorer

## Configure Grafana dashboard

To access the Grafana portal you can use port forwarding like below or expose a route on top of the grafana service.

* Use port forwarding:

```shell
export PODNAME=$(oc get pods -l name=grafana | grep grafana | awk '{print $1}')
kubectl port-forward $PODNAME 3000:3000
```

Point your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

* Expose the route via cli

Add the Prometheus data source with the URL of the exposed routes. [http://prometheus-operated:9090](http://prometheus-operated:9090)

## Alert Manager

As seen in previous section, when deploying prometheus we can set some alerting rules on elements of the Kafka cluster. Those rule examples are in the file `The prometheus-rules.yaml`. Those rules are used by the AlertManager component.

[Prometheus Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/) is a plugin for handling alerts and routing them to a notification service, like Slack. The Prometheus server is a client to the Alert Manager.

* Download an example of alert manager configuration file

```shell
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/master/examples/metrics/prometheus-install/alert-manager.yaml > alert-manager.yaml
```

* Define a configuration for the channel to use, by starting from the following template

```shell
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/master/examples/metrics/prometheus-alertmanager-config/alert-manager-config.yaml > alert-manager-config.yaml
```

* Modify this file to reflect the remote access credential and URL to the channel server.

* Then deploy the secret that matches your config file .

```shell
oc create secret generic alertmanager-alertmanager --from-file=alertmanager.yaml=alert-manager-config.yaml
```

```shell
oc create secret generic additional-scrape-configs --from-file=./local-cluster/prometheus-additional.yaml --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```
